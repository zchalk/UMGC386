                <h3>Search Engine Functionality</h3>
                <p>Search engines work by sending out bots which skim and index all websites they visit. This index includes important information about each site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keywords</li>
                    <li>Content Type</li>
                    <li>Latest Time of Update</li>
                    <li>User Engagement Statistics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Search Engines utilize this index to decide what websites are most relevant to any given search. Other data is also taken into account such as language, location, and device.</p>

                <h3>Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Meta Tags</h3>
                <p>Meta tags allow developers to write a summary of their page that a Search Engine can easily parse and display for users. These descriptions should targetted at the user and use keywords that would effectively entice relevant users to access the site. They should be concise and written in full sentences.</p>

                <h3>Elements of Relevant Navigation Links</h3>
                <h4><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h4>
                <p class="sub-list">Navigation should address content from least complicated to most complicated. For example an online furniture store might organize their content by Room first, then type. This heirarchy makes the page more accessible and easier to nagivate for the user. This heirarchy should also be reflected in the URL</p>

                <h4><strong>Text Based</strong></h4>
                <p class="sub-list">Navigation should rely on text to identify pages. Developers should avoid solely utilizing graphics for navigation and instead combine the two if graphics are used. For example, in mobile development, navigation typically utilizes small grapihics to indicate things like the home page and inbox, but these should also include text identifiers as well. This allows for users who cannot identify the image to still naviagte effectively.</p>

                <h4><strong>Sitemaps</strong></h4>
                <p class="sub-list">Navigational assets exist for the user, but behind the scenes including files like XML sitmaps allows for search engines to more effectively skim webpages.</p>

                <h4><strong>Error Pages</strong></h4>
                <p class="sub-list">Developers should include customized 404 pages for broken pages/links. These pages allow users to easily navigate back to the main site.</p>

                <h3>Good Heading Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>Heading hierarchy is important for both users ans search engine optimization. The most important heading should be wrapped in the smallest number heading. Heading tags go from 1-8. These heading have automatic styling which makes them smaller as the number increases, but should not be used for styling purposes alone. For example, an online news paper would have their title in a H1 tag, as this is the most important heading on their page. Sub-heading like article titles should be in a lesser tag like H2 or H3.</p>
